# curlme

## Terminal-first HTTP request debugging

curlme is a terminal-first HTTP request debugging tool. It allows developers to create temporary HTTP endpoints, capture incoming requests, inspect them in real time, replay traffic to local or remote targets, and diff payloads — directly from the terminal.

This repository is our **primary feedback hub**.

## Feedback

We believe that if feedback requires complex forms, account creation (beyond GitHub), or long explanations, we won't get it. We want to hear from you as easily as possible.

### How to give feedback

1. **GitHub Issues** (Primary): Use this for bugs, feature requests, and general questions.
2. **CLI**: Run `curlme feedback` to be taken directly to the issue page with your environment info pre-filled.
3. **Dashboard**: Use the "Feedback" links in the footer.

### When to use Email

Use email **only** for the following:

- Billing or subscription issues
- Account access problems
- Private security concerns

Email: [support@curlme.io](mailto:support@curlme.io)

Everything else belongs in GitHub Issues.

#### A Note on Responses

This project is built for developers, by developers. To keep the project sustainable:

- We do not owe immediate responses.
- We will close issues that don't fit the vision.
